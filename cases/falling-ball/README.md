# Running a simulation

* Clone this repo
* Go to [FMUs](../../FMUs) and compile the `FallingBall` model
* Copy the compiled model into this directory 
* Run `SolverFMU.py` and `SolverAero.py` in two terminals
* Plot the results by running the `plot-watchpoint.sh` script. It takes the directory of the result files as an input argument, so run `./plot-watchpoint.sh .` from this directory.
