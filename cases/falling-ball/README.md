# Running a simulation

* Make sure the compiled FMU model `FallingBall.so` exists on the `fmu_filepath` provided in `SolverFMU.py`
* Run `SolverFMU.py` and `SolverAero.py` in two terminals
* Plot the results by running the `plot-watchpoint.sh` script. It takes the directory of the result files as an input argument, so run `./plot-watchpoint.sh .` from this directory.
