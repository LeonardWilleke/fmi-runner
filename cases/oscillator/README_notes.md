## Oscillator

A partitioned simulation of a 1D oscillator system with two masses and three springs. The simulation models are implemented either as [FMUs](fmi) or directly in [Python](python). This example is taken from the [preCICE oscillator tutorial](https://github.com/precice/tutorials/tree/master/oscillator). For more information about the setup and how to run it, please visit the original tutorial.
